## Expected Functionalities

1. The host will be logged into the web application and see everyoneâ€™s
   location. As the host gets closer to a participant, the host will have
   directions pointing to his or her location.

2. Participants will be logged in and their locations will be tracked.

3. The host will be able to see location history of all
   the participants after every certain interval of time.

## Installation Instructions

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Install all Node.js dependencies.
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/police-watch/
   npm install
   cd /path/to/police-watch/client
   npm install
   ```
3. Install MySQL.
   ```bash
   npm install mysql
   ```
4. Set up localhost password for MySQL. For [MacOS, use this guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/osx-installation-pkg.html).
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server
   ```

5. Enter your database credentials.
   ```bash
   cp skeleton.js config.js
   nano config.js
   ```

6. Run the SQL script to set-up the bare-essentials for the database. Make sure
   you are running this command in the police-watch directory.
   ```bash
   $ mysql -u root -p
   mysql> create database police;
   mysql> use police;
   mysql> source ./police.sql;
   mysql> exit
   ```

7. Install Bootstrap.
   ```bash
   npm install --save react react-dom
   npm install --save react-bootstrap
   ```

8. Run on localhost.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Division

1. Get GPS working on mobile devices. Get server setup. Be able to render Maps
   onto front-end. Create and query MySQL in Node.js.

2. Set-up user accounts. Be able to personalize on front-end and back-end.

3. Set-up location history. Host be able to see all locations [hopefully] in
   real time.
